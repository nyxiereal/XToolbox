# XToolBox
A toolbox full of Windows 10/11 debloating utilities.  
Made by [Nyx](https://nyx.meowery.eu).

## 🚀 Quickstart
>[!TIP]
> [You can click here to download the latest XTBox zip.](https://github.com/nyxiereal/XToolbox/releases/latest/download/XTBox.zip)  
1. Go to the releases tab.
2. Click on the `XTBox.zip` file attached to the latest release.
3. Unpack the folder and run the `xtoolbox.exe` file.
4. You now have XToolBox running on your computer, pretty cool!

## 📑 Important
1. This program will run __ONLY__ on Windows 10 (tested on 22H2 and LTSC) and Windows 11 (tested on 25H2 and LTSC), it's not advised to use older version of Windows, like Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. If you are using these unsupported versions, please upgrade to a supported one or install Linux. I can't and won't prevent you from using XTB on an older version of Windows tho.
2. If this program gets flagged as malware, it's a false positive, here's why:
    1. It downloads and executes files.
    2. It's packed with UPX.
    3. It's a compiled Dart binary.
